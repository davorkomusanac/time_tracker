# time_tracker

This is a Time Tracker app I made in Flutter completely from scratch, it's purpose (although it still lacks a lot of planned features) is to help track daily time spent on different activities. I chose Provider for state management, and used Listview.builder for generating activities on demand.
This app was made more as a practice app which I solely built and took a lot of inspiration from Time Tracker app on Google Play Store =>
